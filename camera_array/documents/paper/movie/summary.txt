The video shows two experiments of environment classification based on the proposed system. In the first experiment, the video shows six images of the environment. In the top row, from left to right, the Red Left (RedL), Near Infra-Red Central (NIRC) and Red Right (RedR) images are shown. In the bottom row, from left to right, the raw NDVI index, the NDVI based classification before and after the clustering. The environment includes vegetation, snow, soil and concrete. During the experiment, the camera follows a path in the woods. Additionally, some closer looks to the vegetation are shown.

In the second experiment, the video shows the Red Right and Near Infra-Red Central (NIRC) camera in the top row, and the raw NDVI index and the NDVI-based classification in the bottom row. On the right, the reconstructed 3D point cloud of the healthy vegetation is shown. The purpose of this second experiment is to show that the camera system is able to correctly reconstruct the 3D point cloud of the small tree.
